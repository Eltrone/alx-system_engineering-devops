Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

This task expands the distributed web infrastructure to add security, encrypted traffic, and monitoring, making the setup more robust and reliable for hosting www.foobar.com.

Additional components and their purposes:

    3 firewalls: Placed at strategic points (in front of the load balancer, between the load balancer and web/application servers, and in front of the database servers) to protect against unauthorized access and various types of cyber attacks.
    1 SSL certificate: Used to encrypt data between the client's browser and the web server, ensuring that all data transferred remains private and secure. This is especially important for protecting sensitive user information.
    3 monitoring clients: Installed on each server to collect and send data to a monitoring service (like Sumo Logic, Nagios, or Datadog). This allows for real-time monitoring of server health, performance metrics, and security alerts.

Specifics about the infrastructure:

    Firewalls: Act as a barrier between your internal network and incoming traffic from external sources (the internet) to block malicious traffic, such as viruses and hackers.
    HTTPS: The use of SSL/TLS encryption for securing the connection between the client and the server ensures that data is transmitted securely to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
    Monitoring: Essential for maintaining the health of the infrastructure by providing insights into system performance, detecting failures, and proactively addressing potential issues before they affect users.
    Data collection by monitoring tools: These tools typically collect metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and application-specific metrics (e.g., web server request rate) to help in understanding the system's performance and identifying issues.

Addressing potential infrastructure issues:

    SSL termination at the load balancer: While it simplifies SSL certificate management and reduces computational load on the web/application servers, it can introduce a security risk if the internal network is not secure, as traffic between the load balancer and the servers will be unencrypted.
    Single MySQL server for writes: Represents a single point of failure for all write operations. If this server goes down, the entire application could become read-only or completely non-functional until the issue is resolved.
    Identical server configurations: Having the same components on all servers (web, application, and database) can lead to scalability and maintenance issues. It's often better to specialize servers based on their roles to optimize performance and security.

This enhanced infrastructure aims to address the security and operational challenges of running a web application at scale. By incorporating firewalls, SSL, and monitoring, it provides a more secure and maintainable environment for www.foobar.com.
